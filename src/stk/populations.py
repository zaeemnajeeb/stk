class Population:
    """
    A container for  :class:`.Molecule` objects.

    :class:`Population` instances can be nested.

    In addtion to holding :class:`.Molecule` objects, the
    :class:`Population` class can be used to create large numbers of
    these instances through the class methods beginning with "init".

    :class:`.Molecule` instances held by a :class:`Population` can have
    their structures optimized in parallel through the
    :meth:`optimize` method.

    It supports all expected and necessary container operations such as
    iteration, indexing and membership checks (via the ``is in``
    operator).

    Attributes
    ----------
    direct_members : :class:`list` of :class:`.Molecule`
        Held here are direct members of the :class:`Population`.
        In other words, these are the molecules not held by any
        subpopulations. As a result, not all members of a
        :class:`Population` are stored in this attribute.

    subpopulations : :class:`list` of :class:`Population`
        A :class:`list` holding the subpopulations.

    Examples
    --------
    A :class:`Population` can be iterated through just like a
    :class:`list`

    .. code-block:: python

        import stk

        # Create a population.
        pop = stk.Population(
            stk.BuildingBlock(...),
            stk.ConstructedMolecule(...),
            stk.BuildingBlock(...),
            stk.BuildingBlock(...),

            stk.Population(
                stk.BuildingBlock(...),
                stk.ConstructedMolecule(...)
            )

            stk.ConstructedMolecule(...),
            stk.BuildingBlock(...)

        )

        for member in pop:
            do_stuff(member)

    When iterating through a :class:`Population` you will also iterate
    through nested members, that is members which are held by
    subpopulations. If you only wish to iterate through direct
    members, you can

    .. code-block:: python

        for member in pop.direct_members:
            do_stuff(member)

    You can also get access to members by using indices.
    Indices have access to all members in the population

    .. code-block:: python

        first_member = pop[0]
        second_member = pop[1]

    Indices will first access direct members of the population and then
    acess members in the subpopulations. Indices access nested members
    depth-first

    .. code-block:: python

        pop2 = stk.Population(bb1, bb2, stk.Population(bb3, bb4))
        # Get bb1.
        pop2[0]
        # Get bb2.
        pop2[1]
        # Get bb3.
        pop2[2]
        # Get bb4.
        pop2[3]

    You can get a subpopulation by taking a slice

    .. code-block:: python

        # new_pop is a new Population instance and has no nesting.
        new_pop = pop[2:4]

    You can take the length of a population to get the total number
    of members

    .. code-block:: python

        len(pop)

    Adding populations creates a new population with both of the added
    populations as subpopulations

    .. code-block:: python

        # added has no direct members and two subpopulations, pop and
        # pop2.
        added = pop + pop2

    Subtracting populations creates a new, flat population.

    .. code-block:: python

        # subbed has all objects in pop except those also found in
        # pop2.
        subbed = pop - pop2

    You can check if an object is already present in the population.

    .. code-block:: python

        bb1 = stk.BuildingBlock(...)
        bb2 = stk.BuildingBlock(...)
        pop3 = stk.Population(bb1)

        # Returns True.
        bb1 in pop3
        # Returns False.
        bb2 in pop3
        # Returns True.
        bb2 not in pop3

    If you want to run multiple :meth:`optimize` calls in a row, use
    the "with" statment. This keeps a single process pool open, and
    means you do not create a new one for each :meth:`optimize` call.
    It also automatically closes the pool for you when the block
    exits

    .. code-block:: python

        population = stk.Population(...)
        # Keep a process pool open through the "with" statement.
        with population.open_process_pool(8):
            # All optimize calls within this block will use the
            # same process pool.
            population.optimize(stk.UFF())
            population.add_members(...)
            population.optimize(stk.UFF())
        # Process pool is automatically cleaned up when the block
        # exits.

        Remove duplicates from the population.

        The question of which molecule is preserved when duplicates are
        removed is difficult to answer. The iteration through a
        population is depth-first, so a rule such as "the molecule in
        the topmost population is preserved" is not the case here.
        Rather, the first molecule found is preserved.

        However, this question is only relevant if duplicates in
        different subpopulations are being removed. In this case it is
        assumed that it is more important to have a single instance
        than to worry about which subpopulation it is in.

        If the duplicates are being removed from within subpopulations,
        each subpopulation will end up with a single instance of all
        molecules held before. There is no "choice".
